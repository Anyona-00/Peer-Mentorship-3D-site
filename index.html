        <h2>📜 Research</h2>
        <p>
          I thought I was a tech-savvy researcher, with my ability to find your
          embrassing high school Instagram posts. Weuh lemme tell you, Maina,
          when the time came to research the problem statement ……..

        <p>
          One of the biggest things I learned in Month 5 was
          <span id="point">how to do effective research</span>. I figured out
          how to find information that’s really relevant to what I’m interested
          in. It’s like I discovered a secret to unlocking the right
          information!

        <h3>There is alot to learn</h3>
        <p>
          The first round of problem ideation has been incredibly enlightening.
          I've significantly developed my critical thinking skills and realized
          there's still much to learn and alot of room for growth. I'm excited
          to see what the future holds.
